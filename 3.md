## Optional Tasks

The tip calculator in this demo is very basic, and there are a lot of ways that it can be augmented. For example, here's an example of a tip calculator that a student designed.

Feel free to see if you can copy some of the behavior of his design. It's easier to do view animations than it looks, check out the View Animations guide below.

### Other optional tasks

- Remember the bill amount across app restarts. After an extended period of time, clear the state. This is a UI trick that Apple uses with the Spotlight app. If you return there a minute later, it will show your most recent search. if you return 10 minutes later, it defaults to blank. To implement this, plug into the application lifecycle and track time using NSDate.
- Use locale specific currency and currency thousands separators.
- Add a light/dark color theme to the settings view. In viewWillAppear, update views with the correct theme colors.

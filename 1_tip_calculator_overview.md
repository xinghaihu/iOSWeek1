# Creating the Tip Calculator

Before you get started, make sure you have OS X Mountain Lion or above (10.8+), and download XCode 5 from the Mac App Store. You can buy an iOS Developer Program for $99, but it's not required at this stage.

Start reading about Objective-C. Here's a [good quick overview](http://cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn_objectivec/). A more complete primer from Apple is [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html). If you prefer to learn by video, Lynda has a [good overview](http://www.lynda.com/Xcode-4-tutorials/Objective-C-Essential-Training/77860-2.html), it's about 6 hours.

Follow the tip calculator [video walkthrough](https://vimeo.com/74764846) to get the basic tip calculator functionality. After you finish the walkthrough, follow the hints below to add a settings page.
